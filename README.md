# Class_Activation_Map (Tensorflow)
This project includes three scripts that describe how to extract "Activation Map" to explain the performance of the neural network

1. `Class_Activation_Map_MNIST.ipynb` uses [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset.<br>
The model is built by several Conv blocks and the validation accuracy reaches 85% with a few epochs. The result:
